## Contribution rules and guide
  
Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to moviefy. 
You can contribute by writing `code`, documentation in the form of `installation guides` and `style guides`, making Cosmos search friendly and many others. There are endless possibilities. 

Before you start working on an issue, kindly state what you are doing specifically in the concerned issue or create a new issue. If multiple users end up making the pull request for the same task, the person who informed everyone in the issue first will be given preference.
